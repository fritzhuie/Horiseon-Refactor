## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://fritzhuie.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/)


In this refactor, we improved accessability and maintainability without changing the behavior of the client site.

Some of the key changes include:
- Added alt text to all images to improve accessability
- Moved image references from CSS to HTML
- Removed reduntant classes in CSS
- Replaced `<div>` tags with semantic tags

## Code Refactor Example

```html
<div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
```

Converting the above non-semantic div with the class of 'header' to an appropriate [<header> semantic element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp). 

```html
<header>
    <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

```

This change require some additional modification to the CSS selector: 

```css
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

No longer targeting the element on the page with the class of 'header' but instead the css selector targeting the 'header' element 

```css
header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}

```

## Usage 

Load index.html into Chrome or another modern web browser to see the site displayed.

Website should display the same as before the refactor.

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```

## Learning Points 

I learned to utilize semantic tags in HTML to improve readability, and learned about accessability standards across the web.

I learned that background images in DOM elements don't scale like the images in <img> tags do.

I also learned how to break up changes to HTML and CSS into a logical and verbose commit history.
